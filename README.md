# Loan-Approval-Prediction
This project is a Loan Approval Prediction System that uses machine learning algorithms to predict whether a loan should be approved based on applicant data. It involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and evaluating multiple models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. The best-performing model is used to generate predictions on unseen test data.
